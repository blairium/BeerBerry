# pi-so2

This repository builds upon the work of Team K. The application is a **pysimplegui** application that performs a variety of mathematical and analytical tasks on a dataset, and displays results in different graph formats. The project will run on a _Raspberry Pi_ microcomputer, but can also run and be developed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux due to its cross-platform nature.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the application

```bash
python app.py
```

To format code to python pep8 standard

```bash
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive <filename>
```
