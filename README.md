# pi-so2
This is the repository for the pi-so2 project for team K. The application is a **pysimplegui** application that performs a variety of mathematical and analytical tasks on a dataset, and displays results in different graph formats. The project will run on a _Raspberry Pi_ microcomputer, but can also run and be developed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux due to its cross-platform nature.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Node (for development)

## Installation 

To launch the application.

```
